           Var :  Scope of var is global or function level. Variable declared within a function has the function level scope otherwise global scope.
            Can be re-declared multiple times using var key word and same variable name.
            let : Scope of let is block level. Here block is confined to the curly braces ({ and } like function, if or for blocks etc.).
            Variables declared within curly braces can not be accessed from outside the respective scopes.
            Can not be re-declared multiple times using let keyword and same variable name.
            const : Value can not be updated once value is assigned to a const. But properties can be updated.
